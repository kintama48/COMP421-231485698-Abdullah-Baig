### 1. Creation of IAM Role and User
   In the first video, I show how to make an AWS role and a user account with the
   necessary permissions.
### 2. Accessing assigned services with an IAM user account
   I log into the AWS management console with the account I created in the previous
   step and demonstrate that I can only access the services assigned, I couldnâ€™t access
   any other service.
### 3. Delegating a role to an RDS service
   I then create an RDS service and assign it to the role I created in the previous step.
   This allows the app to access the permitted services of our imaginary application.
### 4. Role management AWS
   In this video clip, I demonstrate the Role management page and how we can
   manage permissions and scope of a particular role.
### 5. Delegating a role to an EC2 instance and setting boundary
   I then proceed to demonstrate the delegation of roles to two other services. First I
   delegate a role to an EC2 instance upon creation, it allows the apps running on the
   EC2 instance to access the assigned AWS resources of an account. In the second
   part of the clip, I set boundary permissions to further demonstrate the use of Identity
   Access Management.
